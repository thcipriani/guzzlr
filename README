GUZZLER – as in of gas…
=============================
Guzzler uses:
  * Slim PHP Framework
  * RESTful API implementation (using Slim)
  * MySQL (although Slim uses PDO, so, it's five letters of code from PostgreSQL [wait…P-G-S-Q…yup—five])
  * Backbone.js front-end
  * Built on Twitter Bootstrap

Look, so, here's the thing. I'm really a very lame person. I own a microscope 
and hemacytometer.  I keep data on just about everything. Sometimes, I get 
lazy about storing that data and I'll use Google Docs.

Google docs is great for collaborative spreadsheets, but for recording
gas-mileage its problematic for the following reasons:
  * Lamest mobile interface ever
  * Loading it one my iPhone 3GS takes forever
  * Takes several page-reloads to input data
  * Takes several MORE page-reloads to update Average MPG

Guzzler saves me having to use Google docs. 

Check it out!
I've also included a .sql file that has all of my data for gas mileage back to the beginning of the year
